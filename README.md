cmd/scratches
--
This tool allows you to display your scratchpad windows in polybar. When you click their names in bar, you toggle them.
When scratchpad window is located on currently visible workspace its name is highlighted.

*scratches* truncates window title up to 20 characters by default. If you need to disable it just pass `-truncate 0` argument.
If you have music player in scratchpad you can turn truncate off and see full now playing title, for example.

For each of your scratchpads add this section in polybar config:
```
[module/scratch-SCRATCHPAD_NAME]
type = custom/script
exec = scratches -s SCRATCHPAD_NAME
tail = true
format =  <label>
format-foreground = ${colors.foreground-alt}
click-left = scratches -s SCRATCHPAD_NAME -op toggle
```

You must add `tail=true` to this section as tool subscribes to i3 events and prints titles continuously.
